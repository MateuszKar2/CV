                For three years I was a policeman in Olsztyn. In April 2022, I started the "Fullstack Developer"
                course at GO IT. I learned HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and currently React.js during the course.
                This is my favorite learning phase. Based on components and data management, I can use
                this to create creative and useful websites that provide a seamless user experience. The last
                stage of the course is Node.js.
